// Problem 1: Given the year of birth, if the age is between 13 and 19 (both included) print Teenage and in between 20 and 29 (both included) print Twenties

let a=13-19;
let b=20-29;

let a_check=127;
let b_check=23;
if(a>=a_check)
{
  console.log("Teenage")
}
else if(b<=b_check)
{
  console.log(" Twenties")
}
else
{
  console.log("All are Equal")
}
